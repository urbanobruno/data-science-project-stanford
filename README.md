Datasets Description: We will use the "International Measures of Schooling Years and Schooling Quality 1960-1990" dataset, sourced from the World Bank Microdata Library. This dataset includes various measures of educational attainment and quality across different countries over a 30-year period. Key variables include percentages of the population with different levels of schooling, average years of schooling, pupil-teacher ratios, government expenditure on education, and international test scores in math, science, and reading.

Questions you are asking/analyses you want to perform:
Question: How have the percentages of no schooling, primary, secondary, and higher school attainment and completion changed from 1960 to 1990 across different countries?
Question: What is the relationship/correlation between teacher-pupil ratio and other economic factors with the average years of schooling and education attainment levels, and can we quantify its impact?
Question: Can we predict a country's math, science, and reading test scores based on the average years of schooling, pupil-teacher ratios, government expenditure per pupil and other features?
Question: Can we classify countries into different categories (example: high, medium, low education quality) based on features such as pupil-teacher ratios, government expenditure, average years of schooling and others?
Question: Can we predict the drop-out rates and repetition rates in primary and secondary schools based on economic indicators, teacher salaries, and pupil-teacher ratios?
